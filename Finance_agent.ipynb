      "- **Fundamentals:** TESLA operates in the Consumer Cyclical sector with a market capitalization of approximately $1.37 trillion, a PE ratio of 130.77, and a PB ratio of 19.56. NVIDIA, on the other hand, operates in the Technology sector, specifically in Semiconductors, with a market capitalization of about $3.37 trillion, a PE ratio of 30.96, and a PB ratio of 78.96. NVIDIA's larger market capitalization and lower PE ratio might suggest it is currently undervalued compared to TESLA, considering the significant difference in their market caps and the industries they operate in.\n",
      "- **Dividend Yield and EPS:** TESLA does not offer a dividend, while NVIDIA has a minimal dividend yield of 0.0003. The EPS (Earnings Per Share) for TESLA is 3.67, slightly higher than NVIDIA's 2.53.\n",
      "- **52-Week Performance:** Both stocks have experienced significant fluctuations, with TESLA's 52-week high at $488.54 and low at $138.80, and NVIDIA's 52-week high at $153.13 and low at $58.59. These figures indicate substantial volatility in both stocks over the past year.\n",

However, TESLA's EPS is higher, which could indicate stronger earnings performance.
